## Migration Information

### Upgrading to v2.0.0

**For existing users:** The enhanced script (`generate-wp-symlinks.sh`) provides full backward compatibility while adding powerful auto-detection features. Your existing manual configuration in `active-reset_wp_symlinks.sh` will continue to work, but we recommend trying the enhanced script for easier maintenance.

**Key benefits of upgrading:**

- Zero manual configuration required
- Automatic discovery of new sites and repositories
- Built-in backup and restoration capabilities
- Interactive mode for ambiguous cases
- Dry-run mode for safe testing

See `MIGRATION.md` for detailed upgrade instructions.

### Version Compatibility

- **v2.0.0+**: Enhanced auto-detection with optional configuration files
- **v1.x**: Manual array-based configuration (legacy, still supported)

### Dependencies

- **v2.0.0+**: Requires `jq` for JSON parsing (`brew install jq`)
- **v1.x**: No external dependencies
